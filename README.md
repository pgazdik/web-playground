# Web Playground

These are just various projects to play with HTML/CSS/JS/SVG and maybe NodeJS later.

## Projects

###  `falling-circles`

Simple SVG example with circles being drawn where a mouse is clicked. Each ball starts falling and when hitting the bottom of the window they disappear.


###  `falling-stars`

Example for beginner developers, showing basic HTML/CSS/JS and SVG with a simple  app, written entirely in a single HTML file.

It is similar to `falling-circles`, but draws five-edged stars with pulsating brightness as they are falling down.

The code uses a "Robot" to draw the star. Robot a simple tool for drawing lines using commands to move by a certain amount of pixels or turn by a certain angle.
